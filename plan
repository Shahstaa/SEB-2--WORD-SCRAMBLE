1-	PLAN YOUR PROJECT!

-	Game idea:   Word Scramble
-	User stories:
1.	As a player, I want to see a scrambled word so that I can guess what it is.
2.	As a player, I want to input my guess and submit it.
3.	As a player, I want to receive feedback indicating whether my guess is correct or incorrect.
4.	As a player, I want to see how many attempts I have left.

-	Wire frame (UI drawing/plan):


               WORD SCRAMBLE GAME


                      Scrambled Words:
               [ _ ] [ _ ] [ _ ] [ _ ] [ _ ] [ _ ] 

            Your Guess: _ _ [ submit guess] _ _


                  Attempts Left: [  0  ]

              [ CORRECT / INCORRECT MESSAGE]!




-	Pseudo Code (logical plan in plain language not code) 

1.	First: Create a list of words that can be used in the game - Prepare three categories of words: easy, medium, and hard. Each category will contain different words appropriate for the difficulty level.

2.	The number of attempts: 
Define the number of attempts available for each level:
Easy: 5 attempts
Medium: 3 attempts
Hard: 2 attempts 

3.	Show the player the scrambled word on the screen: Randomly select a word from the chosen level’s list and scramble it (mix up the letters). Display the scrambled word to the player.

4.	Prompt the player to enter their guess.
	- If the player’s guess matches the original word:
	   Display a message saying "Correct!" and end the game.
	- If the player’s guess does not match:
	   Decrease the number of attempts by 1.
	   Display a message saying "Incorrect!" and show the number of attempts left.
	- If the player runs out of attempts:
	   Display a message saying "Game Over!" and reveal the correct word.

5.	After the game ends, offer the player an option to restart the game.
